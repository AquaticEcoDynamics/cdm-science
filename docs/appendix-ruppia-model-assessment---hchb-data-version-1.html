<p><strong>i. Field seagrass shoot count Sep 2020 (obs) vs. HSI germination &amp; sprouting Jul 2020 (model)</strong></p>
<p>Average number of shoots per core sampled in Sep - Oct 2020 were compared with combined HSI for seed germination and turion sprouting in the same year (Figure <a href="appendix-ruppia-model-assessment---hchb-data-version-1.html#fig:hchbv1-shoot2020">9.16</a>). By default, the integration period for germination and sprouting is Apr – Jul, therefore there was around a two-month gap between the end of the model period and the start of the survey period. In addition to the 600m-radius buffer, a 100m-radius buffer was also used as a comparison since there were far more survey sites throughout the lagoon during HCHB and sites were relatively close to each other. 100m is approximately the average width of a grid cell on the model domain.
In general, model outputs agreed with field shoot abundance, despite the two-month gap where environmental conditions were not accounted for. Both field data and HSI outputs suggested higher shoot abundance in the north lagoon compared to the south, likely due to a lower salinity level in the north. Using a 100m-radius buffer seemed to result in a better model fit.
It is worth noting that the seagrass shoot count includes several seagrass species in the lagoon such as R. tuberosa and Althenia cylindrocarpa, whereas the environmental thresholds for seed germination and turion sprouting were derived from experiments on R. tuberosa only (Kim et al. 2013). Although these species can co-occur and may have overlapping requirements on some environmental aspects (Asanopoulos &amp; Waycott 2020), care should be taken when interpreting validation results.</p>

<p><strong>ii. Field flower count Sep 2020 (obs) vs. HSI flowering and seed set Dec 2020 (model)</strong>
Average number of flowers per core sampled in Sep - Oct 2020 were compared with HSI for flowering and seed set in the same year (Figure <a href="appendix-ruppia-model-assessment---hchb-data-version-1.html#fig:hchbv1-flower2020">9.17</a>). By default, the integration period for flowering and seed set is Aug – Dec, which included approximately a two-month period after the survey. Both 600m-radius and 100m-radius buffer were used as a comparison.
Model output generally agreed with field flower abundance, in that the condition in the south lagoon was mostly unsuitable where no flowers were recorded, while the conditions around the middle and north lagoon were more suitable where Ruppia was flowering. Using a 100m-radius buffer resulted in an improved validation score.</p>

<p><strong>iv. Field seed count Mar 2021 (obs) vs. HSI flowering and seed set Dec 2020 (model) </strong>
Average number of seeds per core sampled in Mar – Apr 2021 were compared with HSI for flowering and seed set in the previous year (Figure <a href="appendix-ruppia-model-assessment---hchb-data-version-1.html#fig:hchbv1-seed2021">9.19</a>) using both 600m and 100m-radius buffer. Seed abundance appeared to be less predictable than shoots or flowers, likely because once detached from mother plant, seeds can disperse with water currents before settling down. Kim et al. (2015) studied the physiochemical influences on R. tuberosa abundance in the Coorong and found that only 27% of the seed abundance variation could be explained by salinity, depth and turbidity, which was much less than shoots, flowers or turions. Our NPMR results indicated a similar trend on the HCHB data (Table <a href="habitat-modelling.html#tab:NPMRresult">8.2</a>). Using the bigger buffer produced slightly higher validation scores (R = 0.35) than the smaller buffer (R = 0.25, Figure <a href="appendix-ruppia-model-assessment---hchb-data-version-1.html#fig:hchbv1-seed2021">9.19</a>), which may be a reflection of the Ruppia seeds being able to disperse a small distance (i.e. &gt; 100m).</p>

<p><strong>vi. Field turion count Sep 2020 (obs) vs. HSI turion formation Dec 2020 (model)</strong>

Model predictions did not agree well with field turion abundance, as the environmental thresholds used for turion formation (derived from Kim et al. 2015) was likely biased from a year with very high salinities (discussed in Section 8.1.3.1).</p>

<p><strong>viii. Field algae cover % Sep 2020 (obs) vs. HSI Ulva Nov 2020 or biomass Nov 2020 (model)</strong>
Site macroalgae cover proportion in Sep – Oct 2020 were compared with Ulva HSI and biomass in the same year (Figure <a href="appendix-ruppia-model-assessment---hchb-data-version-1.html#fig:hchbv1-algaecover2020">9.23</a> and Figure <a href="appendix-ruppia-model-assessment---hchb-data-version-1.html#fig:hchbv1-algaecover2020-biomass">9.24</a>). Compared to modelled Ulva biomass, Ulva HSI prediction correlates better with the observed algae cover. This implies the growth controls (as embodied in the HSI) are well resolved, but the seasonal factors leading to biomass accumulation are more complicated and need further refinement. The HSI range was however quite restricted.</p>
