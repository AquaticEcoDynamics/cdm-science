<p>Whilst the Coorong is a naturally saline to hyper-saline lagoon, freshwater flows are important in maintaining estuarine habitat and ecosystem health and preventing extreme hyper-salinity (Brookes et al. 2009). <em>Ruppia tuberosa</em> is an important macrophyte in the Coorong that provides habitat for fish and food for herbivorous birds (Phillips and Muller 2006), and it can tolerate a salinity higher than natural seawater. It therefore is known to concentrate in the mid to southern regions (Figure <a href="cdm-habitat-modelling.html#fig:hab-pic1">5.1</a>).  </p>
<p>The germination and growth of <em>R. tuberosa</em> is known to be governed in large part by changes in salinity and water level regimes, which are influenced by flows through the barrages (Kim et al. 2013). Other factors that influence <em>R. tuberosa</em> growth include nutrient availability, water temperature, sediment quality and interactions with algae, including shading of light and interference with flowers and fruits on the surface. Early summer flows are thought to be particularly beneficial as they delay the drop in water level in the South Lagoon and can prevent extreme salinities emerging, thereby encouraging a more complete reproductive cycle (Collier et al. 2017).</p>
<p>In addition, salinity has also been identified as the key driver that influences fish assemblage structure and the extent of estuarine fish habitat in the Coorong (Ye et al. 2011). This section describes how simulations of <em>Ruppia and</em> estuarine fish habitat have been configured and assessed.</p>

</h3>
<p>The approach adopted in the current study is to simulate “habitat suitability” based on an assessment of modelled environmental conditions relative to the known requirements of Ruppia tuberosa, for example, considering salinity, light and/or other environmental conditions. This approach was then used to define a relative index for each computational cell by overlaying the various environmental controls/limitations that have been informed based on prior experiments and surveys. The <strong><em>Habitat Suitability Index</em></strong> approach empirically defines conditions that lead to successful growth and reproduction, without simulation of processes such as photosynthesis and respiration.</p>
<p>For the Coorong, a similar habitat model approach was undertaken previously by Ye et al. (2014), who focused exclusively on the salinity and water level requirements of Ruppia and presented the model results as an overall probability that Ruppia plants would successfully complete their lifecycle, by accounting for the different tolerances of different life stages.</p>
<p>In this study, we used the hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model to predict environmental conditions at high spatial and temporal resolution for a period of multiple years, and used this to calculate the habitat suitability index (HSI) for each particular phase of the life cycle of Ruppia (Figure <a href="cdm-habitat-modelling.html#fig:lagoonhabitat-pic2">5.2</a>). The calculation of the HSI required the integration of environmental conditions over a biologically relevant time period, based on the typical duration and seasonal timing for each life-stage. HSI results for different life stages were then combined and integrated to obtain overall HSI results for successful completion of sexual or asexual life cycles of Ruppia. For each annual cycle these model results were then summarised over the length of the Coorong, to allow estimation of the total suitable area.</p>

<h4>Ruppia Habitat Suitability Index calculation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ruppia-habitat-suitability-index-calculation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>In each model cell (<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>), the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) is computed based on suitability of conditions (<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>), for each of the main life-stages (<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>), by defining a fractional index, . The fractional index for each attribute is computed at each time, step and then integrated over a 90-day window, specific to the life-cycle stage.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:lagoonhabitat7">\[
\Phi^{HSI_{j}}_{i} = \frac{1}{t_{j_{\text{start}}}-t_{j_{\text{end}}}} \sum^{t_{j_{\text{end}}}}_{t=t_{j_{\text{start}}}}\Phi^{HSI_{j}}_{i}(i)_{t}
\tag{5.1}
\\
\scriptsize{
\\ \text{whereby: $i$ = {salinity, temperature, light, depth, algae}}
\\ \text{and: $j$ = {seed, sprout, adult, flower, turion}}}
\]</span></p>
<p>The integration time for each life-stage, <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, is set to be 90-days based on assessment of literature on the typical impact times reported following shading or disturbance. The optimum 90-day period is selected from within the available plant growth windows, as indicated in Table 2.</p>
<p>The above function is computed in each cell and produces maps of suitability (between 0 and 1) for each environmental attribute for each life stage within any given year. The individual functions are piecewise, based on synthesis of the available literature (Table 3). These are then overlaid to produce a final map for any given year using:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:lagoonhabitat8">\[
\Phi^{HSI}_{c} = \text{min}\left[\Phi^{HSI_{j}}_{c} \right]_{c}
\tag{5.2}
\]</span></p>
<p>To compare the overall area of suitable habitat between years, or the relative suitability of alternate scenarios, the fractional suitability is used as a multiplier with the cell area, according to:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:lagoonhabitat9">\[
A^{HSI} = \sum_{c} \Phi^{HSI}_{c} A_{c}
\tag{5.3}
\]</span></p>
<p>and the spatially averaged HSI in any given region (with area A) is computed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:lagoonhabitat10">\[
\overline{HSI} = \frac{1}{A}\sum_{c} \Phi^{HSI}_{c} A_{c}
\tag{5.4}

<p>The hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model TUFLOW-FV – AED is used to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions (velocity, salinity, temperature and water level), water clarity (light and turbidity) and the potential for filamentous algae (nutrients and algae). Specifically, the HCHB V0.1 model was applied, configured using the specification of AED parameters (….). The Coorong has a long residence time and to account for the longer timescales of water and solute flux, multi-year simulations must be performed.</p>
<p>The habitat suitability functions for each environmental variable of each Ruppia life-stage were determined based on literature review and expert judgement (Table 5.5), and used for the calculation of overall habitat suitability indices (Section 5.1.2). In these tests, the model was run from May 2013 to March 2019 using the base case condition.</p>

<p>The outputs of the model are maps of habitat suitability of critical life stages (Figure 5.6a, showing only the flowering stage in 2018), in response to light, depth, salinity and temperature, which in the end results in a combined probability of sexual or asexual life-cycle completion (Figure 5.6b, showing only the overall HSI for a completion of the sexual life cycle in 2018). The requirements for each life stage are quite different, and when each is superimposed together, the areas where life-cycle completion are limited to the margins of the main lagoons, and the shallow areas around Parnka. From year to year, the area of good habitat changes, depending on that year’s eco-hydrodynamic regime.</p>
<p>By comparing scenarios with different flows into the Lagoon, we can see that there is an expansion of good habitat in the north of the South Lagoon, and along the South Lagoon margins, when extreme salinity values are avoided (Figure 11).</p>

<p>To assess the accuracy of model predictions, the habitat suitability maps produced above were compared with Ruppia field survey results for both distribution and abundance, including several types of plant materials (e.g., shoot, seed, turion) which were used to validate HSI of different life-stages.</p>
<div id="historical-validation" class="section level4 unnumbered">

</h4>
<p><br><strong>i. Field seed/flower count (obs) vs. HSI flowering and seed set (model)</strong></p>
<p>Average number of seeds per core sampled in January from 2017 to 2019 were compared with HSI flowering and seed set of the previous year (2016 – 2018) (Figure 5.7 – 5.10), which is a result of integrated average condition between August and December in each year (Figure 5.3). Number of flowerheads was sampled in November 2016 only, and was compared with HSI flowering and seed set of the same year.</p>
<p>Both of these validation methods are relatively straight forward and should reflect a close link between model output and field observations i.e. if the habitat suitability for flowering and seed set was suitable for existing Ruppia to flower and set seed between August and December, the flower count in November the same year should largely reflect this. Seed count conducted in January the following year should also be a good indicator as the Ruppia that had flowered in the previous year should have set seed by January. However, as it may take several years for the seed bank to deplete, number of seeds recorded each year could potentially be a ‘cumulative’ result of the sexual reproduction success of Ruppia in preceding years. This means there could be a lag between the actual seed count, and the HSI which largely reflects the environmental conditions of the current year only.</p>
<p>Surveys conducted during other times of the year, such as May or July, are more complicated to validated against, as during this period some of the seeds that were produced during last spring would have had germinated. Therefore, the seed abundance at this time is a combined result of previous year’s seed production success, and current year’s seed germination rate.</p>
<p>In general, the spatial distribution of seeds and flowers in the field agreed with model outputs (Figure 5.7 – 5.10). For example, higher number of seeds and flowers were often found in the middle lagoon, overlapping with areas where higher HSIs are concentrated. In comparison, north and/or south lagoons recorded lower density of seeds and/or flowers, matching the lower HSIs or limited suitable habitat extent in these regions. However, there were some disagreements between the modelled HSI and field data in the relative abundance of seeds recorded in the south and north lagoons. Specifically, seeds appeared to be mostly absent in the north lagoon between 2017 and 2019, while they had been in higher abundance in the south consistently. Current model predictions however, predicted that the south and north lagoon had similar habitat suitability for flowering and seed set.</p>
<p>In addition to the visual comparison between model outputs and field observations, a quantitative validation was conducted between seed abundance in 2019 and HSI flowering and seed set in 2018 (Figure 5.9). A 600-meter radius buffer was created around each sampling site, and HSI value in each cell that falls within this buffer were averaged and compared with seed count at each site.</p>

<p><strong>ii. Field turion count (obs) vs. HSI turion formation (model)</strong></p>
<p>Average number of turions (type I and II) per core sampled in January in 2016, 2017 and 2019 were compared with HSI turion formation of the previous year (2015, 2016 and 2018) (Figure 5.11 – 5.13), which is a result of integrated average condition between August and December in each year (Figure 5.3).</p>
<p>As number of turions recorded in January should reflect the habitat conditions for turion formation in the preceding months when HSI for turions were calculated (August to December), this validation method is relatively straight forward, compared to if model outputs were to be validated against surveys conducted during other times of the year such as May or July, as some of the turions formed during previous spring should have had sprouted in May or July in the current year. Such validation will be more complicated as turion abundance in the field is a combined result of previous year’s turion formation success and current year’s turion sprouting rate.</p>
<p>Visual validation of turions showed mixed results (Figure 5.11 – 5.13). HSIs for turion formation in 2015 were generally consistent with turion distribution and abundance in 2016 January, where south lagoon observed more suitable environmental conditions than the north, and field records showed a similar pattern (Figure 5.11). However, the model seemed to underpredict habitat suitability in the south lagoon in 2016 and 2018 (Figure 5.12 and 5.13).</p>

<p><strong>iii. Field shoot count (obs) vs. HSI sexual and asexual combined (model)</strong></p>
<p>Average number of shoots (green and brown) per core sampled in January in 2018 and 2019 were compared with combined overall HSI for successful completions of sexual or asexual life cycle in the previous year (2017 and 2018) (Figure 5.14 – 5.15), which is a result of integrating the HSI results for adult plants, flowering and seed set, seed germination, turion sprouting and turion formation (Figure 5.3).</p>
<p>Although a proportion of Ruppia might have died off in January, the total shoot count including green and brown materials should be a relatively good indicator of environmental conditions experienced in the previous year. Presence of shoots could be a result of sexual or asexual reproduction success, and hence HSI sexual and asexual were integrated for validation.</p>
<p>Similar to turion predictions, the HSI model seemed to relatively underpredict the habitat suitability in the south lagoon, and overpredict in the north in both years (Figure 5.14 – 5.15). Since the model result is an integration of all life stages of Ruppia, this mismatch may be stemmed from a particular life stage, such as the turion formation stage described in the above section.</p>

<p>We undertook an extensive review of the Ruppia monitoring data availability dating back to 1998 within the Coorong lagoon, including distribution and abundance of several types of plant materials (i.e. shoot, seed, turion, flowers) during different seasons. Habitat Suitability Index outputs from the existing model were compared against available field observations to assess model accuracy with a primary focus in recent years (post-2015).</p>
<p>In general, model predictions aligned with the general distribution pattern of Ruppia seeds, but turions and shoots produced mixed results. Detailed investigation is needed to pinpoint potential ways to improve model accuracy. Ruppia environmental thresholds need further refinement as new data become available.</p>
