# Appendix: Habitat Suitability Index Functions {-}


Habitat suitability functions for Ruppia life stages based on literature review and analyses of HCHB survey data. Note that HSI = 1 under optimal conditions, HSI = 0 under unsuitable conditions, and HSI for sub-optimal is linearly interpolated between these values. Rows shaded in green indicate threshold values were largely sourced from current literature (except text in red), while rows shaded in orange indicate threshold values were estimated.
