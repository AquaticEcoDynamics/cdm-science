# Resuspension & Turbidity


<br>

## Overview

In shallow lagoons such as the Coorong, wind-induced waves at the water surface causes the bottom material to resuspend; this can dominate water quality during strong winds, due to large changes in nutrients, suspended solids, and turbidity within the water. Specifically, we seek to capture the role of wind-driven waves on water column suspended solids and organic matter concentration within Coorong.

In order to capture this effect in the Coorong, the SWAN wave model was applied. The wave model predicts the spatial pattern of significant wave height and wave periods and the output is then coupled with the TUFLOW-FV model for modelling shear stress at the seabed and the rate of sediment resuspension.  

The model settings and validation results are described below. Wave and turbidity data are available from experimental work undertaken in 2020 at some sites which is used for calibration purposes, and the particle properties such resuspension rates and settling rates are also discussed.

## Model approach

### SWAN wave model simulation

The SWAN wave model was adopted using a Cartesian grid with 200 m resolution, and the third generation simulation mode. The model was initially forced with the Narrung weather station data and the water depth was interpolated from the existing (2008) Coorong bathymetry data. Wind data at the measurement site was also used for a period when it was available.

### Suspended solids and light

The AED component of the simulation is configured to include light ($I$), and two suspended solids ($SS$) groups.  The TUFLOW-FV -- AED models are dynamically coupled to capture the feedbacks between $SS$, light, surface heating and (optionally) vegetation presence. 

The model accounts for incident shortwave radiation to be attenuated as it penetrates the water column. The attenuation of light is dependent on the specific bandwidth. For primary production, the shortwave (280-2800 nm) intensity at the surface ($I_0$) is partitioned to the photosynthetically active component (PAR) based on the assumption that \~45% of the incident spectrum lies between 400-700nm. PAR and other light bandwidths such as ultra-violet (UV, \~3.5%) and near-infrared (NIR, \~51%), penetrate into the water column according to the Beer-Lambert Law:

$$
I_{i} = f_{i} I_{0} \text{exp} (-K_{d_{i}} z)
(\#eq:lagoonhabitat1)
$$

where $i$ refers to the specific bandwidth range (e.g., PAR, UV, etc), $f_i$ is the fraction of light intensity within that range at the water surface and $z$ is the water depth. The light extinction coefficient $K_d$ is a variable parameter governing light attenuation, as influenced by the suspended solids ($SS$) in the water column, filamentous algae density, and vegetation leaf area index. In these simulations it is computed by assuming a background light extinction coefficient $K_w$ and the specific attenuation coefficient, $K_e$, for $SS$ and algae: 

$$
K_{d} = K_{w} + K_{e_{s}} SS + K_{e_{F}} FA
(\#eq:lagoonhabitat2)
$$

Computing turbidity from the concentration of particulates is also possible and able to be compared to routinely measured turbidity data. The relation for simulation of turbidity is able to be expressed as:

$$
\text{Turbidity} = f_{t_{ss}}\:SS + f_{t_{chl}}\: Chla
(\#eq:lagoonhabitat3)
$$

where $f_{t_{s}}$ is an empirical coefficient, determined through site specific correlations or literature. The suspended solids-turbidity ratio is currently assumed to be 1, and this relationship is based on experimental data from the March 2020 UA field assessment.

### Resuspension

The concentration of suspended solids at any location depends on inputs from tributaries, advection of material through the lagoon, and vertical fluxes due to particle resuspension and deposition. Deposition is computed based on a prescribed settling velocity for each particle group. The rate of resuspension ($R$) varies across the system due to heterogeneity in sediment properties. It is calculated by assuming linearity with the excess shear stress at the bed (Lee et al. 2005), such that:

$$
R_i=\sum_{s=1}^{n_s}{{\ \ f}_{s,i}\ {\ \ \varepsilon}_s}\ \ \text{max}\left(\tau_b-\tau_c,\ 0\right)
(\#eq:lagoonhabitat4)
$$

where $n_s$ is the number of particle size classes, $f_{s,i}$ is the fraction of each particle size class in the  sediment material zone, $\varepsilon$ is the resuspension rate coefficient, $\tau_b$ is the bed shear stress (computed based on the current and wave orbital velocities in each cell), and $\tau_c$ is the critical shear stress for resuspension, which depends on the sediment size (Julien 2010), and optionally, the presence of vegetation. 

The resuspended particles are then subjected to settling assuming a constant settling velocity
$\omega$ of 0.2 m/day. A literature review and current CDM settings of resuspension is summarised in Table xx.

## Validation and assessment

The SWAN wave model was calibrated during the periods between the UA sediment resuspension studies undertaken in December 2020 and March 2021. The comparison between the SWAN wave model outputs and the field survey data of significant wave height is shown in Figure 3.9, which indicates the wave model produced reasonable outcomes in the time variation and magnitude of the response of significant wave height.

```

The wave model output is then coupled to the TUFLOW-AED model to calibrate the sediment resuspension. The resulting turbidity, in comparison with the field observations and the CDM outputs without the waves, at site of A4261209 is shown in Figure 3.10. The comparison indicates the waves introduced resuspension when compared to the ‘no-waves’ scenario, and the model with the wave inputs captured the general variations in the turbidity, though more calibrations to the resuspension events under high wind conditions will be examined in next stages of model development.

## Lagoon scale predictions

Examples of spatial distribution of significant wave height, bottom shear stress (TAUB), resuspension rate, and TSS concentration in the water during a low wind event (Figure xx) and high wind event (Figure xx) are shown below. In general, the wind condition was shown to be the dominant factor of the sediment resuspension rate. During the calm wind condition such as in 01/11/2021 when the wind speed was < 3 m/s, the sediment resuspension rate was negligible. The resuspension rate exceeded 20 g/m^2^/day in 19/11/2020 when the wind speed reached 9 m/s, which subsequently led to increase in the water TSS concentrations. The shallow water in the littoral zones are more vulnerable to the wind-induced resuspension.

## Summary (Sept 2021)

The existing wave model is shown to be well calibrated, and the resuspension model performance is reasonable in terms of resuspension magnitudes and changes in the TSS concentration. However, there are also remaining knowledge gaps/limitations which are to be refined:

1.	Considering more particle groups in the sediment and TSS composition, based on assessment of the UA LISST data.
2.	Adding the Stokes Law method for the parcel setting velocity depending on the particle density and sizes;
3.	Further calibration on the sediment resuspension rates and the critical shear stress for better model performance, also including organic vs inorganic resuspension rates.
