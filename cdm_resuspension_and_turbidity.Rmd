# Resuspension & Turbidity


<br>

## Overview

Waves and currents are the primary mechanisms of sediment resuspension in coastal water. In a shallow lagoon with restricted connection with the ocean such as the Coorong, waves are locally generated by the wind acting on the fetch inside the basin (Green and Coco, 2013; Mosley et al., 2021), and they may also propagate into the basin from the ocean, but the effect is limited within distance to the lagoon mouth. Sediments in aquatic systems are resuspended into the water column when the bottom shear stress becomes greater than the critical shear stress for the initiation of suspension (Van Rijn, 1993). The critical shear stress for the particles is depending on the particle properties such as size and density. 

In order to capture the role of wind-driven waves on water column suspended solids and organic matter concentration within Coorong, the SWAN wave model was applied. The wave model predicts the spatial pattern of significant wave height and wave periods and the output is then coupled with the TUFLOW-FV model for modelling shear stress at the seabed and the rate of sediment resuspension.

The settings of the wave model and the particle properties such resuspension rates and settling rates are described below. Wave data are available from experimental work undertaken in 2020 at sites of Policeman Point and Villa dei Yampa (Mosley et al., 2021, site map available in Figure 4.1). Turbidity data are available from regular monitoring program and HCHB project at multiple sites along the Coorong. These data are used for calibration purposes and the validation results are presented and discussed in the following sections. 


## Model approach

### SWAN wave model simulation

The SWAN wave model was adopted using a Cartesian grid with 200 m resolution, and the third generation simulation mode. The wave model domain covers the CDM domain (Figure 4.1) therefore the wave outputs can be linked with CDM for resuspension simulations. The model was initially forced with the Narrung weather station data and the water depth was interpolated from the existing (2008) Coorong bathymetry data. Wind data at the wave measurement site was also integrated in the wind forcing dataset for the period of field experiments when it was available.

### Suspended solids and resuspension

The field observations of the total suspension solids (TSS) composition showed that the TSS was mostly dominated by the small size particles (<3.8 microns) during the observation periods, while large size particles (186 – 461 microns) may periodically become dominant (Figure 4.2). Based on these observations, the AED component of the simulation is configured to include l three suspended solids (SS) groups, namely:

 - clay, for suspended particles with size < 3.8 microns;
 - silt, for suspended particles with 3.8 microns ≤ size < 186 microns; and
 - sand, for suspended particles with size > 186 microns;

```

The concentration of suspended solids at any location depends on inputs from tributaries, advection of material through the lagoon, and vertical fluxes due to particle resuspension and deposition. Deposition is computed based on a prescribed settling velocity for each particle group. The rate of resuspension (R) varies across the system due to heterogeneity in sediment properties. It is calculated by assuming linearity with the excess shear stress at the bed (Lee et al. 2005), such that:

$$
R_i=\sum_{s=1}^{n_s}{{\ \ f}_{s,i}\ {\ \ \varepsilon}_s}\ \ \text{max}\left(\tau_b-\tau_c,\ 0\right)
(\#eq:lagoonhabitat4)
$$

where $n_s$ is the number of particle size classes, $f_{s,i}$ is the fraction of each particle size class in the  sediment material zone, $\varepsilon$ is the resuspension rate coefficient, $\tau_b$ is the bed shear stress (computed based on the current and wave orbital velocities in each cell), and $\tau_c$ is the critical shear stress for resuspension, which depends on the sediment size (Julien 2010), and optionally, the presence of vegetation. 

The resuspended particles are then subjected to settling assuming a constant settling velocity for each group. The settling velocity is calculated based on the Stokes’ low which balances gravitational forces and drag:

w_s=(d^2 g(ρ_s-ρ_w))/18η                     (2)

where w_s=settling velocity (m s-1); d=particle diameter (m); g=acceleration of gravity (m s-2); ρ_s=particle density (kg m-3); ρ_w=water density (kg m-3); and η=kinematic fluid viscosity (kg m-1 s-1); a literature review and current CDM settings of resuspension is summarised in Table 4.1.

TABLE

For the simulation of sediment resuspension and their impacts on the water quality, the sediment of Coorong was categorized to 10 zones from north to south, and each zone was further divided into 3 sub-zones in the deep water and both sides of shallow water in order to categorised the sediment properties in the shallow and deep water along the Coorong from north to south (Figure 4.3). The sediment properties of particle size and organic matter fraction were set based on the sediment survey data (details of sediment survey and results are described in chapter 7 - sediment biogeochemistry), which were then interpolated into the zones based on the sediment particle sizes and organic matter contents. The details of sediment particle property settings in each zone are summarized in Table 4.2. 

### Suspended solids and light

The AED component of the simulation is configured to include light ($I$), and two suspended solids ($SS$) groups.  The TUFLOW-FV -- AED models are dynamically coupled to capture the feedbacks between $SS$, light, surface heating and (optionally) vegetation presence. 

The model accounts for incident shortwave radiation to be attenuated as it penetrates the water column. The attenuation of light is dependent on the specific bandwidth. For primary production, the shortwave (280-2800 nm) intensity at the surface ($I_0$) is partitioned to the photosynthetically active component (PAR) based on the assumption that \~45% of the incident spectrum lies between 400-700nm. PAR and other light bandwidths such as ultra-violet (UV, \~3.5%) and near-infrared (NIR, \~51%), penetrate into the water column according to the Beer-Lambert Law:

$$
I_{i} = f_{i} I_{0} \text{exp} (-K_{d_{i}} z)
(\#eq:lagoonhabitat1)
$$

where $i$ refers to the specific bandwidth range (e.g., PAR, UV, etc), $f_i$ is the fraction of light intensity within that range at the water surface and $z$ is the water depth. The light extinction coefficient $K_d$ is a variable parameter governing light attenuation, as influenced by the suspended solids ($SS$) in the water column, filamentous algae density, and vegetation leaf area index. In these simulations it is computed by assuming a background light extinction coefficient $K_w$ and the specific attenuation coefficient, $K_e$, for $SS$ and algae: 

$$
K_{d} = K_{w} + K_{e_{s}} SS + K_{e_{F}} FA + + K_{e_{F}} PHY
(\#eq:lagoonhabitat2)
$$

Computing turbidity from the concentration of particulates is also possible and able to be compared to routinely measured turbidity data. The relation for simulation of turbidity is able to be expressed as:

$$
\text{Turbidity} = f_{t_{ss}}\:SS + f_{t_{chl}}\: Chla
(\#eq:lagoonhabitat3)
$$

where $f_{t_{s}}$ is an empirical coefficient, determined through site specific correlations or literature. The suspended solids-turbidity ratio is currently assumed to be 1, and this relationship is based on experimental data from the March 2020 UA field assessment.

The major components of N/P released by resuspension was the particulate forms (Tang et al., 2020). Therefore, the resuspension of the particulate organic matter is considered in the model. The organic matter resuspension rate is calculated as:

where $i$ is the number of particle group, $R_i$ is the resuspension rate, and $f_{OM-frac}$ is the organic matter fraction in the sediment. 


### Resuspension

The concentration of suspended solids at any location depends on inputs from tributaries, advection of material through the lagoon, and vertical fluxes due to particle resuspension and deposition. Deposition is computed based on a prescribed settling velocity for each particle group. The rate of resuspension ($R$) varies across the system due to heterogeneity in sediment properties. It is calculated by assuming linearity with the excess shear stress at the bed (Lee et al. 2005), such that:

$$
R_i=\sum_{s=1}^{n_s}{{\ \ f}_{s,i}\ {\ \ \varepsilon}_s}\ \ \text{max}\left(\tau_b-\tau_c,\ 0\right)
(\#eq:lagoonhabitat4)
$$

where $n_s$ is the number of particle size classes, $f_{s,i}$ is the fraction of each particle size class in the  sediment material zone, $\varepsilon$ is the resuspension rate coefficient, $\tau_b$ is the bed shear stress (computed based on the current and wave orbital velocities in each cell), and $\tau_c$ is the critical shear stress for resuspension, which depends on the sediment size (Julien 2010), and optionally, the presence of vegetation. 

The resuspended particles are then subjected to settling assuming a constant settling velocity
$\omega$ of 0.2 m/day. A literature review and current CDM settings of resuspension is summarised in Table xx.

## Validation and assessment

### Wave characteristics

The SWAN wave model was calibrated during the periods between the UA sediment resuspension studies undertaken in December 2020 and March 2021. The comparison between the SWAN wave model outputs and the field survey data of significant wave height is shown in Figure 3.9, which indicates the wave model produced reasonable outcomes in the time variation and magnitude of the response of significant wave height.

```

### Lagoon scale turbidity

The wave model output is then coupled to the TUFLOW-FV - AED model to calibrate the sediment resuspension. 

Examples of spatial distribution of significant wave height, bottom shear stress (TAUB), resuspension rate, and TSS concentration in the water during a low wind event (Figure xx) and high wind event (Figure xx) are shown below. In general, the wind condition was shown to be the dominant factor of the sediment resuspension rate. During the calm wind condition such as in 01/11/2021 when the wind speed was < 3 m/s, the sediment resuspension rate was negligible. The resuspension rate exceeded 20 g/m^2^/day in 19/11/2020 when the wind speed reached 9 m/s, which subsequently led to increase in the water TSS concentrations. The shallow water in the littoral zones are more vulnerable to the wind-induced resuspension.

The resulting turbidity, in comparison with the field observations and the CDM outputs without the waves, at sites of A4261165, A4261209 and A4261135 is shown in Figure 4.5. The comparison indicates the waves introduced more resuspension when compared to the ‘no-waves’ scenario and the model with the wave inputs captured the magnitudes in the turbidity and the timing of high turbidity events in general. However, the results also showed that the wave effects on the turbidity diminished from south to north. While in the north lagoon (site of A4261135), the turbidity showed similar results between the ‘with wave’ and ‘without wave’ scenarios, indicating that the current dominated the resuspension in the north lagoon. Though the wave has a significant effect on the turbidity, the effect on the nutrient concentration is relatively small. An example of TN concentration at the same sites between the ‘with wave’ and ‘without wave’ scenario is presented in Figure 4.6, where shows the difference of TN concentration between the scenarios are generally < 10%, probably due the fact that the Coorong has a large stock of nutrient in the water therefore the resuspension contribution is small when compared to the existing stock. The full comparison results of key water quality parameters between the ‘with wave’ and ‘without wave’ scenarios is enclosed in the Appendix B: Results Archive.

## Summary

The existing wave model is shown to be well calibrated, and the resuspension model performance is reasonable in terms of resuspension magnitudes to capture changes in the water column turbidity. The results also showed that the coupling of wave model within CDM helped to capture the high-turbidity events that occured within the south lagoon. The results suggest that the driver for sediment resuspension transitions from a mix of wave and currents in the south lagoon to being primarily current dominated in the north lagoon, similar to the findings in other lagoon systems (e.g. Green and Coco, 2013). 

In shallow aquatic system, hydrodynamics and diffusion are regarded as crucial factors to controlling sediment nutrients exchange. More specifically, two modes are responsible for nutrient release from sediment layers to overlying water, i.e., static release by nutrient diffusion in relatively calm situation caused by concentration gradient, and dynamic release accompanied by hydrodynamic-induced sediment resuspension in the shallow lake (Tengberg et al., 2003; Tammeorg et al., 2015). In open water where the fetch is long, In particular, the dynamic release is the dominant mode in the actual situations since the water-sediment interface is frequently disturbed by  hydrodynamic processes (Tammeorg et al., 2015). However, from the point of view of the long-term nutrient cycle,  natural resuspension may make a small contribution to the nutrient release and diffusion release may dominate (Blackburn, 1997).  The results for the Coorong based on these CDM simulations has shown that the effects of wind-induced resuspension on the nutrient release is relatively mild. This is coincident with the field survey of waves and resuspension in the Coorong, that there was no significant change in (total) nutrient levels due to resuspension (Mosley et al., 2021). Also, the sediment experiment showed a strong diffusive nutrient flux of NH_4 and PO_4 under calm condition, which indicate the diffusive flux of nutrient is the major process of sediment release in the Coorong. Nonetheless, in Chapters 5 and 7, we do include parameterisations for OM resuspension and surficial pore-water flushing when resolving the sediment-water nutrient exchange.
