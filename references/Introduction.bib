This system is an incredibly important habitat for waterbirds, supporting more than 1\% of the global populations of nine waterbird taxa and hosting up to 90\% of waterbirds in the Murray-Darling Basin during drought. Modifications to flow have dramatically altered the salinity and water regime in the Coorong, which has impacted the abundance, distribution, and range of the biota in the Coorong. Prudent management and River Murray flows are critical to maintain the ecology of this site into the future. This chapter details the change in hydrology and salinity that has occurred in the Coorong and explores options for contemporary management.}},

While the physical and biogeochemical variables are forecast mechanistically using the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the Chesapeake Bay, the species predictions are generated using a novel mechanistic-empirical approach, whereby real-time output from the coupled physical-biogeochemical model drives multivariate empirical habitat models of the target species. The predictions, in the form of digital images, are available via the World Wide Web to interested groups to guide recreational, management, and research activities. Though full validation of the integrated forecasts for all species is still a work in progress, we argue that the mechanistic-empirical approach can be used to generate a wide variety of short-term ecological forecasts, and that it can be applied in any marine system where sufficient data exist to develop empirical habitat models. This paper provides an overview of this system, its predictions, and the approach taken.}},

abstract = {{Based on a comprehensive synthesis of data available within the literature, a new process-based model of microbial pollution is presented, which is applicable for surface and coastal waters. The model is based on a generic set of parameterisations that describe the dynamics of most protozoan, bacterial and viral organisms of interest, including pathogens and microbial indicator organisms. The parameterisations dynamically account for the effects of temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, sunlight, nutrients and turbidity on the growth and mortality of enteric organisms. Parameters for a range of organisms are also presented which are based on collation of literature data. The model has been implemented within an aquatic ecology model, Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model (CAEDYM), which can couple to multidimensional hydrodynamic models. Without adjustment of the literature derived parameter values, a 3-D implementation is validated against observed data from three freshwater systems that differ in their climatic zone, trophic status and operation. The simulations highlight the spatial and temporal variability that may be encountered by operators. Additionally, large differences in the fate and distribution of different species originate from variable rates of growth, mortality and sedimentation and it is emphasized that the use of surrogates for quantifying risk is problematic. The model can be used to help design targeted monitoring programs, explore differences between species, and to support real-time decision-making. Areas where insufficient understanding and data exist are discussed.}},

Within three weeks of this rainfall event, a large, mono-specific bloom of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa had developed in the estuary, with cell counts peaking at over 100,000cellsml???1. A three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model, ELCOM-CAEDYM, was applied to the period of development and subsequent decline of the bloom. The model, previously calibrated for more typical years (1995 and 1996) when there was no bloom, accurately reproduced the unusual hydrodynamic conditions in the estuary as well as the approximate magnitude and timing of the M. aeruginosa bloom. The model results supported the hypothesis that salinity and temperature are the primary factors controlling the growth of M. aeruginosa during the period of interest. The simulations described in this study show how the model captures the complex interactions between the physical and biogeochemical environment, and indicate the usefulness of the model as a predictive management tool.}},

The Coorong estuary at the terminus of Australia's River Murray supports an economically important fishery as well as being recognised internationally as a critical site for migratory birds. Salinity near the Murray Mouth varies between fresh and marine depending upon river flow, but the Coorong becomes increasingly saline along its 120?km length. Freshwater flow to the Coorong is naturally variable but has significantly reduced by extraction for irrigated agriculture and domestic use upstream. Extreme drought from 2000 to 2010 and over-allocation of water resources resulted in the cessation of freshwater flow to the Coorong, significantly increasing salinity. During this period the diversity and abundance of organisms in the Coorong declined which reduced food web complexity. During lower flows the system generally becomes less productive as evidenced by: lower nutrient concentrations and loads, lower chlorophyll and primary productivity, a decrease in the abundance of fish-prey items (zooplankton, macroinvertebrates and small fish), a decrease in fish abundance, although this is not well reflected in fishery catch data because of the concentration of fishing in available habitat. The maintenance of flow is the only management strategy that stimulates recruitment, delivers nutrient resources to the estuary and ensures maintenance of habitable area by maintaining appropriate salinity.}},

Based on annual waterbird censuses conducted between 2000 and 2007, spatiotemporal analyses revealed that significant differences in waterbird community structure exist along the length of the Coorong. This spatial diversity in community structure was also found to be temporally consistent over this 8-year period. The abundance of the most numerically dominant bird species, such as red-necked stint Calidris ruficollis and grey teal Anas gracilis, explained much of this spatial variation. However, comparisons between data collected for the Coorong south lagoon in 1985 and 2000-2007 show that dramatic changes in these waterbird communities have occurred over longer periods of time, with 23 of the 27 most common species having declined in this period by at least 30\%. The Coorong still regularly supports globally important populations (>1\% of global population) of nine waterbird taxa, including three Palearctic shorebirds, confirming its Ramsar status.

abstract = {{Water is one of the main elements of the environment which determine the existence of life on the Earth, affect the climate and limit the development of civilization. Water resources management requires constant monitoring in terms of its qualitative-quantitative values. Proper assessment of the degree of water pollution is the basis for conservation and rational utilization of water resources. Water quality in lakes and dams is undergoing continuous degradation caused by natural processes resulting from eutrophication and due to anthropogenic reasons. One of the tools that are used to solve problems of surface water pollution is modelling of changes which take place in lake waters and associated water quality changes. In the last thirty years a rapid development of mathematical modelling of water resources quality has been observed. A number of computer models have been designed which are successfully applied in practice in many countries, including Poland. This paper presents an overview of mathematical models for assessment of water quality in dam reservoirs. Description of the WASP program which will be used for modelling water quality in the Sulejow Reservoir was the focal point. Jednym z narzędzi znajdujących zastosowanie w rozwiązywaniu problemów ochrony wód powierzchniowych przed zanieczyszczeniem jest modelowanie matematyczne. Odpowiedni model może zostać wykorzystany do przeprowadzenia prognoz jakości wody, przy uwzględnieniu zmian czynników oddziałujących na jakość wód czy też zmian ich natężenia. O prawidłowości oceny stanu środowiska za pomocą modeli decydują z jednej strony znajomość procesów zachodzących w środowisku i odpowiedni dobór równań matematycznych je opisujących, a z drugiej dostępne zbiory danych, czyli wyników pomiarowych wskaźników jakości wody, które są wykorzystywane do estymacji parametrów i współczynników danego modelu. W ostatnich latach coraz powszechniej w badaniach naukowych wykorzystuje się metody symulacji komputerowych, dotyczy to zwłaszcza badań nad jakością środowiska wodnego. Metody analizy komputerowej stały się samodzielną gałęzią badań naukowych, która w zasadniczy sposób zwiększa możliwości badawcze nowoczesnych inżynierów-ekologów. W ostatnich trzydziestu latach nastąpił dynamiczny rozwój modelowania matematycznego jakości zasobów wodnych. Opracowano wiele skomputeryzowanych modeli, które zostały z powodzeniem zastosowane w praktyce w wielu państwach, w tym w Polsce. W niniejszej pracy przedstawiono przegląd modeli matematycznych, służących ocenie jakości wód w zbiornikach zaporowych. Bardziej szczegółowo skupiono się na omówieniu programu WASP, który posłuży do modelowania jakości wód w Zbiorniku Sulejowskim (woj. łódzkie).}},

abstract = {{The Gold Coast City is the tourist center of Australia and has undergone rapid and massive urban expansion over the past few decades. The Broadwater estuary, in the heart of the City, not only offers an array of ecosystems services for many important aquatic wildlife species, but also supports the livelihood and lifestyles of residents. Not surprisingly, there have been signs of imbalance between these two major services. This study combined a waterway hydraulic and pollutant transport model to simulate diffuse nutrient and sediment loads under past and future proposed land-use changes. A series of catchment restoration initiatives were modeled in an attempt to define optimal catchment scale restoration efforts necessary to protect and enhance the City’s waterways. The modeling revealed that for future proposed development, a business as usual approach to catchment management will not reduce nutrient and sediment loading sufficiently to protect the community values. Considerable restoration of upper catchment tributaries is imperative, combined with treatment of stormwater flow from intensively developed sub-catchment areas. Collectively, initiatives undertaken by regulatory authorities to date have successfully reduced nutrient and sediment loading reaching adjoining waterways, although these programs have been ad hoc without strategic systematic planning and vision. Future conservation requires integration of multidisciplinary science and proactive management driven by the high ecological, economical, and community values placed on the City’s waterways. Long-term catchment restoration and conservation planning requires an extensive budget (including political and societal support) to handle ongoing maintenance issues associated with scale of restoration determined here.}},

Specifically, the model was used to explore the physical and biological processes that determined the temporal and spatial variability of Microcystis aeruginosa (hereafter Microcystis) biomass during an abnormally intense mono-specific bloom event. Inclusion of the buoyancy control function within the coupled model considerably improved the model predictability by capturing the biomass accumulation at the surface during the bloom, and the shift of the dominant group from green algae to cyanobacteria. Results indicated that physical processes, particularly inflow mixing, played a dominant role in determining the spatial heterogeneity of Microcystis biomass through the local control of nutrient availability. In addition, the shallow mixed layer depth (zm) relative to the euphotic depth (zp) under a stable thermal stratification provided a perfect physical habitat for the dominance of this cyanobacteria relative to other species, due to their buoyancy control capability. This work demonstrates that the coupled hydrodynamic and ecological modeling has advanced to a stage where it may be used to interpret field data and subject to a suitable level of validation, the model may be used as a management decision support tool.}},
