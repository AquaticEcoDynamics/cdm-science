abstract = {{Picophytoplankton (i.e. cyanobacteria and pico-eukaryotes) are abundant and ecologically critical components of the autotrophic communities in the pelagic realm. These micro-organisms colonized a variety of extreme environments including high salinity waters. However, the distribution of these organisms along strong salinity gradient has barely been investigated. The abundance and community structure of cyanobacteria and pico-eukaryotes were investigated along a natural continuous salinity gradient (1.8\% to 15.5\%) using flow cytometry. Highest picophytoplankton abundances were recorded under salinity conditions ranging between 8.0\% and 11.0\% (1.3 × 106 to 1.4 × 106 cells ml-1). Two populations of picocyanobacteria (likely Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus) and 5 distinct populations of pico-eukaryotes were identified along the salinity gradient. The picophytoplankton cytometric-richness decreased with salinity and the most cytometrically diversified community (4 to 7 populations) was observed in the brackish-marine part of the lagoon (i.e. salinity below 3.5\%). One population of pico-eukaryote dominated the community throughout the salinity gradient and was responsible for the bloom observed between 8.0\% and 11.0\%. Finally only this halotolerant population and Prochlorococcus-like picocyanobacteria were identified in hypersaline waters (i.e. above 14.0\%). Salinity was identified as the main factor structuring the distribution of picophytoplankton along the lagoon. However, nutritive conditions, viral lysis and microzooplankton grazing are also suggested as potentially important players in controlling the abundance and diversity of picophytoplankton along the lagoon. The complex patterns described here represent the first observation of picophytoplankton dynamics along a continuous gradient where salinity increases from 1.8\% to 15.5\%. This result provides new insight into the distribution of pico-autotrophic organisms along strong salinity gradients and allows for a better understanding of the overall pelagic functioning in saline systems which is critical for the management of these precious and climatically-stress ecosystems.}},

abstract = {{Between 2004 and 2009, South Australia suffered its longest period of below average annual rainfall. This impacted riverine ecosystems and particularly the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), the largest river system in Australia. The MDB combines 30,000 wetlands of which the Coorong wetland is of significant importance for the reproduction of bird and fish species, and is listed under the Ramsar Convention. We sampled water in the Coorong wetland between 2011 and 2013 and compiled additional data from 1997 to 2013 to assess the impact of the drought and subsequent recovery of the environment. The salinity levels of the Coorong wetland increased dramatically during the drought because of the lack of freshwater inflow from the Murray River. The changes in water flow observed from 2002 to 2009 had an impact on the number of habitats present along the Coorong wetland. In addition, a shift in community composition was observed between the freshwater habitat (<5) dominated by chlorophytes to the hypersaline habitat (>85) dominated by diatoms. It is evident that during the drought, the Coorong wetland was dominated by diatoms and dinoflagellates. After the drought, the North Lagoon was dominated by chlorophytes up to a salinity level of 20. However, over 20 and in the South Lagoon, diatoms dominated the community. This study highlights how salinity levels drive the phytoplankton community. Based on the complementary data obtained for salinity between 1997 and 2010, there is a significant difference between the salinity levels observed during the drought and those observed before and after the drought. It appears that salinity levels are now recovered to what they were in the late 1990s.}},

abstract = {{Estuaries are widely viewed as hotspots of primary productivity. The Coorong in South Australia is an inverse estuary divided into two lagoons, extremely important to the associated riverine, lacustrine and marine environments and characterized by a steep, lateral salinity gradient. Here, we analyzed the abundance and distribution of primary producers over two years (August 2011–2013) and investigated the biogeochemical factors driving observed changes. The phytoplankton community was numerically dominated by chlorophytes in the North Lagoon with Chlorohormidium sp. and Oocystis sp. being the most abundant species. In the South Lagoon, diatoms dominated the community, with Cylindrotheca closterium, Cyclotella sp. and Cocconeis sp. being the most prevalent species. Finally, cryptophytes and dinoflagellates were found to be present throughout both lagoons but in comparatively much lower abundances. Salinity was the most important driver of phytoplankton communities and ranged from 0.15 to 72.13PSU between August 2011 and August 2013. Chlorophytes were found to be most prolific in freshwater areas and abundances rapidly declined laterally along the Coorong. Beyond a salinity threshold of 28PSU, extremely limited numbers of Crucigenia sp. and Oocystis sp. were observed, but abundance were seven to ten-fold lower than in less saline waters. The salinity of the North Lagoon was found to be directly controlled by the flow volume of the River Murray, however, no effect of river flow on the South Lagoon was evident. Our findings suggest that management plans for the Coorong need to be put into place which can regulate salinity regimes via river flow, even during periods of drought. This is highly important in order to maintain low enough salinities throughout the North Lagoon, ensuring a continued healthy ecosystem state.}},
