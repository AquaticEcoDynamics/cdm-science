abstract = {{Our study aimed at elucidating the role of internal loading in the budget of phosphorus (P) and assessed the importance of resuspension and diffusive fluxes for P cycling in large, shallow Lake Peipsi. The internal loading of P was quantified by a mass balance approach that considered the gross sedimentation of P as a component. The gross sedimentation of P was measured with sediment traps during May–October 2011. Additionally, we followed the monthly dynamics of diffusive fluxes and resuspension of P within this time period. The gross sedimentation of P dominated the mass balance calculations in Lake Peipsi. The resuspension of P constituted 62–68\% of the gross sedimentation of P, and thereby accounted for the bulk of the total internal P load. Until late July, the release of P by diffusion was similar in magnitude to that of resuspension. Since August, resuspension was of governing importance for P cycling: the release of P by resuspension at that time was about 40-fold higher than that of the diffusion. Therefore, diffusion and resuspension provided a continuous supply of P to the water column during the growing season.}},

abstract = {{The effect of resuspension on sediment–water solute exchange was studied in the archipelago outside the city of Göteborg (Sweden) during the winter months 2001/2002 by a combination of benthic flux (employing both in situ and laboratory incubations), meteorological and hydrodynamic measurements. Resuspension was created in in situ incubation chambers to study the possible resuspension effect on the fluxes of nutrients, oxygen and total carbonate. In most cases, resuspension changed the flux rates. The fluxes of oxygen, total carbonate and phosphate decreased during the resuspension event. The oxygen fluxes before resuspension were between 15 and 23 mmol m−2 day−1 in the four chambers, and decreased during resuspension to between 8 and 18 mmol m−2 day−1. The fluxes of total carbonate in the chambers before resuspension were 12–35 mmol m−2 day−1 and decreased to 4–15 mmol m−2 day−1. The change for each flux during resuspension was statistically significant. The fluxes of nitrate–nitrite and silicic acid increased, whereas the fluxes of ammonium did not change significantly. Hydrodynamic and meteorological data showed that the natural created resuspension at the study site were not due to wind-induced waves, but to strong bottom currents that can be caused when water built-up against land during strong wind events. When the wind abates, the water is flushing back and creates strong currents high enough to cause resuspension of the bottom sediments. A major storm passing the area during the experimental period caused particulate material to suspend to a concentration of about 11 mg/l in the bottom water, which was similar to the suspended material concentration in one set of the incubation chambers.}},

abstract = {{Waves are fundamentally important to the physical and biological functioning of estuaries. Understanding and predicting contaminant transport, development of sedimentary structures, geomorphological response to changes in external forcings such as rising sea level, and response of estuarine ecosystems to contaminant stressors require understanding of the relative roles of wave- and current-driven sediment transport. We review wave-driven sediment resuspension and transport in estuaries, including generation of bed shear stress by waves, initiation of sediment motion by waves, and the ways waves modulate, add to, and interact with sediment transport driven by currents. A key characteristic of the wave-induced force on the seabed is extreme spatial and temporal variations; simple analytical models are revealing of the way such patterns develop. Statistical methods have been widely applied to predict wave resuspension of intertidal-flat bed sediments, and physically based predictors of resuspension developed from open-coast studies appear to also apply to short-period estuarine waves. There is ample experimental evidence to conclude that over the long term, waves erode and tidal currents accrete intertidal flats. Waves indirectly add to the formation of fluid mud by adding to the estuarine pool of fine sediment, and waves may fluidize subtidal seabeds, changing bed erodibility. Models have been used to explore the dynamic balance between sediment transport by waves and by currents and have revealed the key control of waves on estuarine morphology. Estuarine intertidal flats are excellent natural laboratories that offer opportunities for working on a number of fundamental problems in sediment transport.}},

abstract = {{Simulation models were used to predict the concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), ammonium and nitrate in sediment pore waters, under various conditions. The quantity of particulate organic matter (POM) undergoing decomposition varied from 5–85 mmol C m−2 d−1; this POM had C:N ratios of 5 or 10, and was distributed in three different ways. The POM was either located close to the sediment surface, or decreased linearly from the surface, or was completely mixed into the sediment. The effect of resuspending the sediment to various depths, for this suite of profiles, was determined. The different distributions gave unique patterns, but it was concluded that sediment must be resuspended to considerable depth before any major contribution was made to the overlying water. Thus, at the highest POM degradation rate, in order to get a liberation of ΣN of 5 mmol m−2, it was necessary to resuspend the top, linear and mixed distributions to depths of 2.4, 1.2 and 0.8 cm respectively. The model predicted that after mixing of the latter to 2.4 cm, profiles of ammonium and other molecules had returned to pre-mixing values after ∼ 5 h. It was predicted that resuspension would not increase the quantity of nitrogen molecules exported to the overlying water, but it would affect the timing.}},

abstract = {{Intermittent turbulent bursts have great impacts on sediment resuspension in coastal regions, tidal estuaries, and lakes. In this study, the role of turbulence structure on sediment resuspension was examined at Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China. The instantaneous three-dimensional velocity and suspended sediment concentrations were synchronously recorded by Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) and Optical Backscatter Sensor (OBS) placed close to the lakebed. Statistical and quadrant analyses results revealed that the coherent structure contributed significantly to sediment particle entrainment. The intermittent burst events (dominant ejection and sweep) were the main energy source for sediment resuspension processes. 99.2\% of turbulent sediment fluxes were triggered by ejection and sweep events, whereas the contributions coming from the outward interactions and inward interactions were relatively small. The large-amplitude burst events in the coherent structure dominated the influence on the sediment diffusion. Additionally, it was found that instantaneous sediment particle entrainment occurred earlier than the mean critical shear stress, which was induced by the stochastic nature of turbulence. The amount of sediment flux considering the turbulence characteristics was one or two larger magnitudes than the flux amount assessed by the time-averaged flow field, which indicated the critical shear stress approach might underestimate the sediment resuspension. Therefore, the influence of turbulence performance on sediment entrainment shall be seriously considered when evaluating sediment flux and internal nutrient loads in Lake Taihu.}},

The evidence suggests that resuspension is episodic in all systems with the spatial extent of resuspension being determined by the wind speed, duration of disturbance, effective lake fetch and lake morphometry. The rates of deposition of resuspended material vary greatly with measurements recorded between 0.5 and 50 g m−2 d−1. In many systems and at many times of year resuspended material comprises the majority of the flux of particles to lake bottoms. An order-of-magnitude estimate of the long-term contribution of resuspended material to the total flux of particulate matter is 85\%.}},

abstract = { The effect of stress state on the unsaturated shear strength of a Korean residual soil was studied using modified triaxial tests. Experimental results show that the soil-water characteristic curve and shear strength of this soil are significantly affected by the change of net normal stresses. This effect should be taken into consideration in the model to precisely describe the shear strength envelope of unsaturated soils. Thus, a new model for estimation of unsaturated shear strength is proposed using the soil-water characteristic curve and the saturated shear strength parameters.Key words: prediction model, soil-water characteristic curve, matric suction, triaxial test, unsaturated shear strength. }
